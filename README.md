# MM1queue

<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>The aim of the project was to familiarize with the M/M/1 queue, and to implement the event simulator of this queue. The task of such a simulator would be to imitate the M/M/1 queue operation algorithm, and to save the output parameters of the simulation in order to collect system statistics.

  The first part of this project was to simulate a regular M/M/1 queue with various input parameters, and compare these values with the theoretical values of these parameters. After the set of appropriate parameters, it was necessary to plot how the value of the p(0) parameter changed over time, and compare this plot with the plot of the p0 value from the stationary distribution.

  In the second part of the project, it was necessary to modify the queue simulation algorithm so that the server would serve customers all the time. If there are no clients and the buffer is empty, the server would have to deal with imaginary clients, the service time of which would be the same as for real clients. In such a system, the arrival of a "real" customer would not dispossess the "imaginary" customer from service.</p>
